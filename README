There are two ways to approach stage 3, the way i would do it normally would be using a tool called Portman
This is open source and writes tests for a open api defination which can then be run in postman and automated via a github action or some other ci/cd pipeline option and it can run against the deployment pipeline.

Linked is the portman repo:
https://github.com/apideck-libraries/portman

The github action will run either by manually been triggered or on a merge to main. Currently due to the defect with the orderids not accepting a order id it wont complete so as you can see the tests currently fail in the github action. This could be implemented as part of the build pipeline so if this was the fail the whole pipeline would fail ensuring a releae would not go out.

To easily see the test which i have produced via portman you can use the postman folder to import into Postman for a cleaner view.

I have also included variation tests which covers the negative scenarios of the apis calls. These are found in the variations folder.

Defects for this task:
Delete, put and get orders returns a 500 error when a valid Id is passed in.

unforunatly i have not been able to work out how to do questions:
"Verify that each order from the previous step is returned in the /orders list with the expected details"
"Confirm how many orders were created before the current date"

Im sure it is possible to do so doing this format but with the time constraints i wasnt able to work that out yet.

Thanks
