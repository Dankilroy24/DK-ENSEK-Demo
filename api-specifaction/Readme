There are two ways to approach stage 3, the way i would do it normally would be using a tool called Portman
This is open source and writes tests for a open api defination which can then be run in postman and automated via a github action or some other ci/cd pipeline option and it can run against the deployment pipeline.

To Create the tests i have used a open source tool called Portman which reads the open api spec and allows you to easily make API tests from it.

Linked is the portman repo:
